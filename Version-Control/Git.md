## Git
Azure DevOps supports two types of source control: **Git** (distributed) and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC). TFVC is a centralized, client-server system. In both Git and TFVC, you can check in files and organize files in folders, branches, and repositories.

With Git, each developer has a copy of the source repository on their dev machine. The source repo includes all branch and history information. Each developer works directly with their local repository. Changes are shared between repositories as a separate step.

Developers can commit each set of changes and perform version control operations, such as history and compare without a network connection. Branches are lightweight. When developers need to switch contexts, they create a private local branch. Developers can quickly switch from one branch to another to pivot among different variations of the code base. Later, developers can merge, publish, or dispose of the branch.
