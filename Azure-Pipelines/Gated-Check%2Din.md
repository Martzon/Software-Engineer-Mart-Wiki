A CI pipeline custom-made for testing pull requests. This pipeline is designed **to test and build incoming code from a pull request** so that errors or issues can be easily corrected before getting merged into the target branch. Even though it will be under the CI pipelines, this pipeline shouldnâ€™t publish anything.
