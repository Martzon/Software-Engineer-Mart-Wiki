ASP.NET controllers are never instantiated, so we need to configure it with a mechanism where we can inject itâ€™s components such as services implicitly. .NET core supports and encourages DI by default

- In your Api project, through extension methods. We will create separate classes to inject separate pieces of codes (particularly services) to make it more SRP compliant
   - Folder Structure: Api > Extensions > Injection
- Each service e.g. UserService will have its own extension class that extends IServiceCollection and implements injection as illustrated below:

- Which then be consumed in the Startup.cs class:

- Make sure to pass IConfiguration because some injection requires configured values such as connection strings or api keys.
