Please contact our administrator for installing **Visual Studio**. The rest can be downloaded for free

1. **Visual Studio 2019+ Community**
    - The IDE for developing backend
    - Consider installing VS 2019 community as it also installs .NET Core 3.1

1. **.NET Core 3.1 LTS (As of July 2020) and/or latest**
    - Any projects created beyond this point should have v3.1+. V2.2 is for backwards compatibility


1. **Visual Studio Code**
    - The text editor for developing "Frontend"
    - Installing extensions would also be helpful. Feel free to install anything that would help you as these are free. At the minimum you should install:
        - TSLint
        - Auto Import
        - GitLens
        - Sort TypeScript Imports

1. **npm - v10 and higher**
    - Needed to install certain packages and cli. For example, angular has its own cli to enable you to create projects and actually run them

1. **Git**
    - Install using the windows installer. We use git as our version control so this would be sufficient to allow you execute git commands such as clone
